# What is Hugobricks?

[View DEMO website](https://www.hugobricks.preview.usecue.com/)

Hugobricks is a free website theme for Hugo. It makes building Hugo websites child’s play due to its stackable (LEGO-like) content bricks. Stack an intro brick on top of some image bricks and a pricing table and build a complete website in seconds!

### Hugobricks leitmotiv

In the past you may have chosen a Wordpress theme and adjusted the images, colors and fonts to the needs of your client. In combination with tools like Gutenberg blocks and page builders like Elementor you would get not just a head start, but also tremendous flexibility and lots of ready to use and reusable components. There was little that could compete with such power, which is reflected by the amount of Wordpress installs. Wordpress has since been replaced by the Jamstack as the preferred way of building for the web, resulting in faster and more robust websites. However, it has not been able to compete with Wordpress when it comes to themes, flexibility and components... until now. Hugobricks brings all the advantages of old-skool Wordpress websites to the Jamstack eco-system. When you choose for Hugobricks you get a head start, tremendous flexibility and lots of ready to use and reusable components.
