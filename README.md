### Hugobricks workflow

Hugobricks aims to enhance the Hugo web framework by providing a variety of pre-made bricks for straightforward website-building.

Our companion project, [hugocodex](https://hugocodex.org), guides beginners in starting a Hugo project from scratch. For those who already have experience with Hugo and want to use it for rapid prototyping and iterating, Hugobricks offers premade websites and customizable components powered by Hugo.

Cloning this repository allows you to start building lightning-fast static sites with flexibility and ease with and already working website.

### Hugobricks under the Hood

- [Partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)

 Hugobricks takes advantage of these features to allow content re-use, pivot around content and layouts, and calling the required styling and functional logic.
