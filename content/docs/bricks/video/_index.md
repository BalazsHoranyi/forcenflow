title: Video brick

Say you want to achieve this neat Video 'component'

Sagan Ipsum ...

The brick creates an image and a link to Vimeo. The classes on this link tell the CSS to add the Vimeo logo and add a play button. This makes it look like an embed. Note that when you load the [lightbox](/add-ons/lightbox/) from this website, your video will automatically open in a lightbox instead of in a new page. Below you find a demo (with the lightbox enabled).

\!/ requires hugobricking it first, naturally !
