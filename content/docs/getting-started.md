In order to get a working website feel free to 

- clone our repository and start building with stackable content bricks.
- enjoy your already working hugo website, plan your changes/iterations
- re-use default hugobricks
- and/or customise them !


### Hugobricks leitmotiv

In the past (around 2013), you may have had to choose a Drupal or Wordpress theme and make specific choices regarding colors, fonts, etc. Essentially, you would have a customized version of a pre-made theme like 'Bootstrap Drupal' for Drupal or a similar theme for Wordpress. The overall structure and layout of the site would remain mostly unchanged. However, in 2023, you can now have a similar easy-to-use theming and site building workflow with Hugobricks, thanks to Hugo.

## How to use it? What'sthe suggested site building workflow:

1.- Identify the patterns of repeatable/reused along the website content pieces.

2.- Start using the offered bricks (like sort of 'components')

3.- Want to go beyond? Maybe by changing some styles, color palette, fonts, etc... (see 'Settings' - configuration parameters - docs. section)

4.- Go iterating and hugobricking... enjoy it!
