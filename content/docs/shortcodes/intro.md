Self explanatory: provides a nice basic Intro section.
Just style (if needed) it and place it at wish in you website, by means of the following 


```
{{</* intro "" "" */>}}
```

invoking the 'intro' message.


In this sample website, you can see it in action in the 'Home' page, underneath the navigation bar.
