# What's the difference in between a hugo 'shortcode' and a  hugo 'brick' ?

Shortcodes are aiming at placing reusable content in a kind of 'inline' way (say in between two paragraphs).
Bricks are complete sets of content.

> NOTE: Take the FAQ's case: it could either a just list of 'frequently asked questions' that goes in between paragraphs or it could be a more complete content part that you stack onto
other content parts. It can be used as both.
