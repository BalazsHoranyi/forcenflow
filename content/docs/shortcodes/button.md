![Button](/uploads/shortcodes/button.png "Button")

Self explanatory: provides a nice button.
Just style (if needed) it and place it at wish in you website, by means of the following 


```
{{</* button "" "" */>}}
```

invoking the shortcode.

> NOTE: the two parameters in quotes relate to 'href' and text in the button


In the above screenshot case:

```
{{</* button "/getting-started/" "Get started for free" */>}}
```


> NOTE2: (for the curious), note how the the 'Intro' is 'calling it' ! (in the same way we have just described)
