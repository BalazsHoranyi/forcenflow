### Logo image

This sets the image in the header. Omitting a value here results in a 'text logo' as you can see on this website. The text logo consists of the value in `title` field that can be found in the 'general.yaml' file in the data folder and the `logo_subtitle` field that you can find in this data file.

### Logo subtitle

When you choose to omit the value for `logo_image` the 'text logo' will appear. The text logo consists of the value in `title` field that can be found in the 'general.yaml' file in the data folder and this `logo_subtitle` field.

### Mobile view at

This numeric value determines at which width the class 'mobilemenu' is added to the body. This class acts as a adjustable media query. In the example it is set to 1000, which means a width of 1000 pixels.
