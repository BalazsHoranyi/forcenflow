# What is Hugobricks ?

> Hugobricks is a free website theme for Hugo. It makes building Hugo websites childâ€™s play due to its stackable (LEGO-like) content bricks. Stack an intro brick on top of some image bricks and a pricing table and build a complete website in seconds!

You can see it as configurable Theme. Our goal is to offer a hassle-free and efficient workflow for building Hugo websites with minimal effort. We strive to maintain high standards of quality and style. Additionally, our solution is easy to deploy and requires minimal sysops effort and cost for self-hosting. If you need any assistance with this, we would be more than happy to provide support.

Please refer to the relevant sections in the Documentation for more information.
