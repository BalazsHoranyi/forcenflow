title: F.A.Q. brick
---

Want to add an informative most frequently asked questions? :

```
{{/* < faq > */}}
```

Fine. Say you want to achieve this neat FAQ 'component' markup (in a series of Q & A, prefixed with short text, and maybe different sections of). Should be enough to call it like that:

```
{{< faq >}}
```

Done.

Want to see it in more bricks/stackable way ? Have a look at the [FAQ page in here.](/faq)

It combines FAQs with :

{{/* < brick_title > */}}

{{/* < breadcrumbs > */}}

bricks.
