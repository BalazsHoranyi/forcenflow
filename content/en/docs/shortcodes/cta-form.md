A call to action (CTA) form is an essential part for your websites conversion. The settings for this form can be found in the 'ctaform.yaml' file in the data directory. You can see the form in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show the contact form in your content, write the following shortcode:

```
{{</* ctaform */>}}
```

<!--{{< ctaform >}}-->
